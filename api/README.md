# NACE predictor API

An API that provides prediction services for NACE codes based on a provided ML model.

## Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3. Configure a virtual env or whatever way of running you prefer.

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Application configuration

The app is configured through the [configuration file](config.json).

While a `config.json` file is provided in the code, this should be considered a default.
A custom configuration is expected to be provided on deployment.

### Configuration elements

#### Model

Information about the underlying ML model the API should use. It contains model metadata
such as the name of the model, and where the binary is located.

Supported model types:
- FastText

Supported artifact types:
- LocalFile
- GCPStorage

Both artifact types require an `artifactInfo` element with a `path` field, where
`path` points to where the artifact is located (either on the local file system or in GCP storage).

Note that when using a GCP storage artifact type, the file must either be publicly accessible,
or accessible with the  credentials the application is running with (e.g. by [setting application 
default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login)
on your machine when running locally). 
 
### Auth

Information about users that are authorized to use the "usage reporting" functionality of the application. 
 
## Running the application

### Locally

To start the application, run `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the application provides the API (with documentation) at http://localhost:5000.

### As a GCP App Engine service

The `app.yaml` file and naming the Flask variable in `main.py` `app` prepares the application
for deployment on [Google Cloud Platform App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/runtime).

To deploy the application, run 

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

Note that the [GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) must be installed and authenticated against the GCP project you are deploying to.

### As anything else

The application is a "plain" Flask Python app, and should be simple to package for 
use in other services (such as Kubernetes). 

Files for App engine deployment (`app.yaml`, .`gcloudignore`) can be ignored safely.

## Testing

Unit tests are found in [tests](), where the folder structure matches that of the main application.

For convenience (and CI/CD use), [a script](quality_check.py) to discover and run all tests is included. 
To execute it, run

```bash
python quality_check.py
```
